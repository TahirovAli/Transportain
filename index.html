            <h1>Car</h1>
            <h2>About Car</h2>
            <p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. 
			Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. 
			Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
			Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts. 
			In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.

            <h1>Plane</h1>
            <h2>About Plane</h2>
            <p>An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. 
			Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations.
			The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. 
			Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement. 
			Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.
The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as "the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight".</p>

            <h1>Boat</h1>
            <h2>About Boat</h2>
            <p>A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.
Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. 
In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.
Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. 
Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats. </p>

            <h1>Train</h1>
            <h2>About Train</h2>
            <p>In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight. 
			The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning "to pull, to draw". 
			Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as "engines"), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units.
			Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons. Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails. 
			Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, which allows low friction and makes them more efficient than other forms of transport. 
			Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables.

            <h1>Bus</h1>
            <h2>About Bus</h2>
            <p>A bus (contracted from omnibus,with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a public transport road vehicle designed to carry significantly more passengers than the average cars or vans. 
			Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers,although the average bus usually carries between 30 and 100. 
			The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. 
			Coaches are used for longer-distance services.
			Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. 
			In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence.</p>
